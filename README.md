# Covid Tracker Application

## [App Demo](https://covid-tracker-niko.herokuapp.com/)

### About the project

Another small project build with React where I wanted to practice more to fetch data from apis. Also wanted to test how React Leaflet works.

Application fetches data from [disease.sh](https://github.com/disease-sh/api) api and shows different data from cases, deaths and recoveries. User can also change country from dropdown menu and then data changes to show data from that country.
Also the map whats made with React Leaflet pins current country on map and user can check from there current state of active and critical cases of that selected country.
